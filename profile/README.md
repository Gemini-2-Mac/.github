## What is Gemini 2?  

**Gemini 2** is an advanced **duplicate file detection tool** designed to help users clean up their storage effortlessly. It scans folders, drives, and cloud storage for identical or similar files, giving you full control over what stays and what goes.  

The app uses intelligent comparison algorithms to detect duplicates, near-duplicates, and redundant versions of files like photos, videos, documents, and music tracks. With its intuitive interface, you can preview results, review recommendations, and delete unnecessary items safely.  

Gemini 2 also includes a **Smart Cleanup mode**, which learns your selection patterns and applies them automatically during future scans. It integrates seamlessly with Finder and supports both local and external storage drives.  

With a lightweight design, instant previews, and fast processing, Gemini 2 keeps your workspace organized and efficient. Itâ€™s built for performance, reliability, and data safety â€” offering precise cleanup without risk of accidental deletion.
